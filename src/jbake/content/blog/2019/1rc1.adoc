Version 1.0-RC1 has been released! The next release will be 1.0!

Please get your feedback, comments, and suggestions in soon!

== New Features

This release has two great new features: *Variables*, and Config through *Properties*.

From the manual:

*"`Enabled the use of Properties file. For example: new Config(props) or GrooCSS.withPropertiesFile(filename) or with the Gradle plugin you can use propertiesFile = file("groocss.properties") within the task definition. Allows the property "processorClasses" to be a list of class-names separated by commas for Processors to use.`"*

*"`Added the ability to add variables to Config and have them available in scripts.`"*

TIP: See the http://www.groocss.org/manual/1.0-RC1/index.html[new manual for more] about these features.

== Flavors

1.0-RC1 works with Groovy 2.5 but you can specify 1.0-RC1-groovy2.5 or  1.0-RC1-groovy2.4 if you want to use Groovy 2.4.

Future releases might only work with Groovy 2.5 and up.
